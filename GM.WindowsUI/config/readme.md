Extract the decrypted contents of the connection settings file from the Android app's .apk and save in this folder as "configuration.json"

IMPORTANT: If you are able to extract it, DO NOT DISCLOSE the contents of this file. GM went to lengths to keep the contents secret.

I would also advise against sharing the decryption algorithm should you figure it out.
